- **Text book**: *Fabrication  Engineering at the Micro- and Nanoscale* by Stephen A. Campbell.

- **Courses**: *EE5577 Micro- and Nanoscale Fabrication Technology* 

- **What I should master after studying?**

  		- Explain and sketch a full **CMOS or MEMS process flow**, including both **FEOL **(Front-End-of-Line) and **BEOL** (Back-End-of-Line) steps.   

  		- Understand the **physical principles** behind each major process - *oxidation, diffusion, ion implantation, etc*.
  		- **Evaluate trade-offs** among process, material, and performance.

    - **Design or modify** process flows for real devices.

- **Final Goal**

  - Try to apply fabrication insights to beyond-CMOS devices or accelerators.
