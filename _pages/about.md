This site serves as my personal knowledge repository - a place to organize and consolidate what I learn throughout my Ph.D. journey.
Here I collect and refine materials such as:

- Course notes and learning summaries
- Insights from research papers, experiments, and code
- Reflections and discoveries during my research

The goal is to make my learning process more structured and traceable, while also sharing useful knowledge with others who might benefit from similar topics.
